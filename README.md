Hi, I'm Kevin, a 39-year-old with a bright outlook on life and a strong commitment to everything I do. I live in the heart of Hesse, Germany, with my amazing wife and our two dogs. I bring positivity and dedication to both my work and personal life.

I'm now eager to transition into development for a couple of reasons. My wife is a backend developer and her work has inspired me. Plus, I've always had a passion for new technologies. I see a great opportunity to combine my skills as a graphic designer with frontend development, merging creativity with tech in a way that excites me.
In addition, I am currently completing a three-year vocational training programme to become an IT specialist for system integration.
