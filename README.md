Hi, I'm Kevin, a 38-year-old with a bright outlook on life and a strong commitment to everything I do. I live in the heart of picturesque Hesse, Germany, in a cozy home I share with my amazing wife and our two beloved dogs. I bring positivity and dedication to both my work and personal life.

I'm now eager to transition into development for a couple of reasons. My wife is a backend developer and her work has inspired me. Plus, I've always had a passion for new technologies. I see a great opportunity to combine my skills as a graphic designer with frontend development, merging creativity with tech in a way that excites me.


And don't forget chickens are awesome!
