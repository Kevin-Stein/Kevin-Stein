# welcome visitors

Hi everyone, my name is Kevin and i moved to Hessen 2 months ago and I'm starting the Web Dev course next week.
I have worked as a graphic designer/ DTP operator and advertising technician.
I waste ;-) my free time on my two dogs and video games.
I am looking forward to meeting you all.
